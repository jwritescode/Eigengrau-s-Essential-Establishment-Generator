You make your way around the $tavern.wordnoun, and chat with a couple of the locals. They are friendly enough for simple $town.type folk, and are happy to share a drink with you, and gossip easily- apparently, $bartender.name $bartender.trait<<nobr>>.<</nobr>> When you steer the conversation towards rumours that they've heard, the half-drunk $tavernPatron.raceNote looks around, and in a hushed voice, whispers
	<<elseif _PlotHookRumourRoll is 2>>
You talk amongst the good folk of $town.name, who seem pleasant enough. They gossip easily, and reckon that $tavern.name is only known for its $tavern.draw, and that the pub across the road is totally way better. You steer the conversation towards topics that are more interesting to adventurers such as yourselves, and the drunk $tavernPatron.raceNote looks around, and whispers in a hushed voice
