Every time he rolls ABOVE ten (or PASSES TEN–whence the name of the game), the banker must return double the stake to all the players in the game. After three losses of the roller (no matter how many wins), the roller position is passed to another gamer in the circle. The banker changes after each roll.",

The game they play around the table with these curious articles is a sort of Lilliputian game at cups and balls; and the beauty of it lies in seeming to place the pepper-corn under one particular thimble, getting the $NPCgamer.racenote who is playing to bet that it was there, and then winning $NPCgamer.hisher money by showing that it is not.",
